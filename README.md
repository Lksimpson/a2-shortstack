## Lindberg's Package Delivery Service
This project is a page that would allow clients to send packages through a courier. To use this project, input the description of the package, the weight of the package in pounds and the deadline (in number of days) for the package to reach the destination. The application then calculates and displays the cost of this shipment based on the weight of the package and the deadline. The three fields used here are the description, weight and deadline, while the derived field is the cost of shipment. I used CSS grid for the positioning technique to allow the form to be on one side of the page, and the table/database to be on the other side
Include a very brief summary of your project here. Be sure to include the CSS positioning technique you used, and any required instructions to use your application.
